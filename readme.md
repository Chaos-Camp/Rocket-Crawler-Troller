## What Is This Wondrous Contraption?

Greetings, fellow netizen! Welcome to the world of **Rocket-Crawler-Troller**. While some people build mazes for mice, we've crafted a digital labyrinth for web crawlers. This isn't just any maze; it's an infinite, winding path with no cheese at the end. 🚫🧀

## Features 🌌

- **Infinite Loops**: The Bermuda Triangle of the internet. Web crawlers check in, but they don't check out.
  
- **UUID Mysteries**: Just when they think they've mapped it all, a wild UUID portal appears. Back to square one, little crawler.
  
- **No Escape**: Our troller is like Hotel California for web crawlers. They can check out anytime they like, but they can never leave.

## How to Set the Trap 🕷️

Luring unsuspecting crawlers into our web is as easy as 1-2-3:

1. `git clone https://github.com/CHaos-Camp/rocket-crawler-troller.git`
2. `cd rocket-crawler-troller`
3. `docker-compose up -d`

Then, sit back, relax, and watch the digital spectacle unfold.

## A Note of Caution ⚠️

This tool is crafted with mischief in mind. It's intended for educational purposes and to have a bit of fun. Always use responsibly and ethically. And remember, not all those who wander are lost, but web crawlers in our troller definitely are!
